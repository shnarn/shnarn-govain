            <h1>Academy Committee Timetable for Monitoring Behaviour and Attendance</h1>
            <p class="lead">This timetable outlines the responsibilities and schedule for the academy committee, with a focus on the link governor for behaviour and attendance, to ensure pupil needs are met, statutory requirements are fulfilled, and effective monitoring and appraisal processes are in place. It aligns with UK primary school academic terms and incorporates Ofsted expectations, safeguarding requirements, Education Act 2002 (Section 175 for safeguarding), and Education Act 2011 (Sections 2, 5, 38, 56 for discipline and governance).</p>
