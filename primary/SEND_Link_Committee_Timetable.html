            <p>This timetable is designed for a SEND link committee member (often referred to as a link governor) responsible for monitoring Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) in a primary school. It ensures that pupil needs are identified, met, and appraised, while fulfilling statutory requirements outlined in the SEND Code of Practice. The academic year is divided into three terms: Autumn (September–December), Spring (January–March/April), and Summer (April/May–July).</p>
