            <p>This timetable is designed for the academy committee, with a specific focus on the link governor for behaviour and attendance, to ensure robust oversight of these critical areas in a UK secondary school. It aligns with the academic calendar (Autumn, Spring, Summer terms) and addresses pupil needs, including those of SEND, EAL, and disadvantaged pupils (e.g., Pupil Premium), through targeted monitoring and interventions. The timetable ensures compliance with statutory requirements, including the Education Act 2002 (Section 175 for safeguarding, Section 51A for exclusions), the Education Act 2011 (Sections 2, 5, 38, 56 for discipline and governance), and the Education (Pupil Registration) Regulations 2006 for attendance. It incorporates Ofsted expectations, safeguarding protocols, and age-appropriate strategies for secondary pupils, such as restorative practices and exam-related support, while facilitating staff appraisals and parental engagement to promote a positive school environment.</p>
