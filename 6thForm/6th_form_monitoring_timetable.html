                <h2 class="section-title">Role Overview</h2>
                <p>The Link Member provides governance oversight for 6th Form subjects, ensuring high-quality education, pupil progress, and compliance with statutory requirements (e.g., DfE curriculum standards, SEND Code of Practice, safeguarding). The expectations focus on monitoring teaching quality, pupil needs, and statutory compliance while collaborating with the Senior Leadership Team (SLT), subject leads, and pastoral staff. The academic year is divided into four terms (Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer), with tasks distributed to maintain consistent oversight without micromanaging operational duties.</p>
