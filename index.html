                <h3 class="card-title">Welcome to Governor Aid</h3>
                <p class="card-text">As a seasoned school governor with extensive experience in both maintained schools and academies, spanning primary and secondary education, I have identified a critical need for a structured approach to governor responsibilities. Many governors, like myself, are not education specialists, and the operational systems within schools can differ significantly from familiar professional environments, often leaving governors uncertain about where to begin.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Governor Aid addresses this challenge by providing a clear schedule for conducting oversight activities and a comprehensive guide on what to review initially. While designed with academies in mind, this tool is equally applicable to maintained school settings, ensuring broad relevance.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Additionally, Governor Aid includes a standardized Visiting Form, which must be completed for every school visitâ€”whether meeting with the Head of School, reviewing scheduled activities, conducting a routine walk-through, or fulfilling chair responsibilities. This form ensures all critical elements of the visit are documented, creating a formal record that protects governors and supports accountability in the event of reported or observed incidents.</p>
                <p class="card-text">To ensure preparedness for an Ofsted inspection, the governance structure operates in accordance with a clearly defined and structured schedule, demonstrating robust oversight and accountability.</p>
